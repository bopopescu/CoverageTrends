# CoverageTrends
This archives headlines and links on news websites every four hours. Working on getting it down to less time using less space, but wanted to start archiving sooner than later.

# main.py
Sets timers to run every 4 hours

# scraper.py
uses each parser in parsers to scrape each news site and add to the daily csv for each news source.

# archived links
contains a folder for each news site, where within each folder there's a .csv for each day with the headlines and urls on the home page at each scrape.
